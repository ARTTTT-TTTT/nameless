## üìñ Story

> **Long, long, long time ago...**  
There was a group of people known as the **Treasure Hunters**. Their mission was to seek out and uncover forgotten relics and ancient artifacts.

This is the story of one among them‚Äîan unnamed soul, known only as:

- **The Nameless Treasure Hunter**  
- **The Weakest Human Being**  
- **The Quick Learner**

One day, he stumbled upon an unexplored ruin‚Äîuntouched by mankind, mysterious, and filled with unknown dangers. Despite his weakness, he learns fast. He made the decision to enter...  

To face the unknown.  
To find the treasure.  
And to walk the path that may lead him to his final destination.

## üß† Inspiration

Nameless takes inspiration from the legendary **Elden Ring**, developed by *FromSoftware*.  
We aim to capture the sense of mystery, danger, and exploration that defines the Souls-like genre ‚Äî  
offering challenging gameplay, cryptic lore, and a journey of discovery through ancient ruins.
